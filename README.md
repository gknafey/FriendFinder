# FriendFinder

### Overview

FriendFinder is a website that allows you to take a survey and then the website sends the information to the server and comes back to you with your optimal friend based on the results of your survey. 

## How it works

The server sends the html files to the user and when the user interacts with the frontend, the server responds with more html and and some javascript and returns a modal after you have submitted the survey.

## Code 

Server.js hosts the website, htmlRoutes.js handles the paths for the different pages. ApiRoutes.js handles the ajax calls from the frontend and friends.js holds the friends information in an array of objects.

## Technologies Used

The website makes use of the following:
    *Heroku 
    *node.js
    *path
    *express
